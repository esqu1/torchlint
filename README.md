# TorchLint

![TorchLint](./TorchLint.png)

TorchLint is a basic static analyzer and linter for the PyTorch machine learning framework, featuring
warning messages for mismatched sizes in tensor operations and operations on tensors residing
on different devices.

Done for [CIS 552](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis552/current/index.html) Fall 2019 at the University of Pennsylvania, which is the reason for this project being done in Haskell.
